how can I define a common variable file to roles in an ansible collection?


ChatGPT

In an Ansible collection, you can define common variables that are accessible across multiple roles within that collection. Here’s how you can achieve this:
Directory Structure

Assume your Ansible collection directory structure looks like this:

css

my_collection/
├── README.md
├── galaxy.yml
├── roles/
│   ├── role1/
│   │   ├── tasks/
│   │   ├── defaults/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── role2/
│   │   ├── tasks/
│   │   ├── defaults/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── vars/
    ├── main.yml
    └── ...

    roles/: Directory containing all the roles in your collection.
    vars/: Directory where you will place your common variable files.

Defining Common Variables

    Create a vars/main.yml file inside your collection's vars directory. This file will contain your common variables.

    yaml

# vars/main.yml

common_variable1: value1
common_variable2: value2

Accessing Common Variables in Roles:

To access these common variables within roles, you can use them in role-specific variables (defaults/main.yml or vars/main.yml within each role) or directly within tasks.

For example, to use common_variable1 in role1:

yaml

# roles/role1/defaults/main.yml

role1_specific_variable: "{{ common_variable1 }}"

Similarly, you can use common_variable1 in tasks directly:

yaml

    # roles/role1/tasks/main.yml

    - name: Example task using common variable
      debug:
        msg: "Common variable 1: {{ common_variable1 }}"

Including Variables in Playbooks

When you include your collection in a playbook, these common variables will be available for use across all roles within the collection.
Note:

    Ensure that your roles correctly reference the variables from vars/main.yml or defaults/main.yml within each role.
    Ansible will automatically load variables from vars/main.yml and make them available to all roles in the collection when you run your playbook.

This method allows you to maintain centralized and reusable variables across multiple roles within an Ansible collection, promoting consistency and simplifying maintenance of your playbooks and roles. Adjust the paths and file names based on your specific collection structure and naming conventions.
