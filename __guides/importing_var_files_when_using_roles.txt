I am creating an ansible role. in vars directory I have multiple variable files. How do I import them to tasks?





ChatGPT

In Ansible, if you have multiple variable files organized within the vars directory of your role and you want to import them into your tasks, you can use the include_vars task or the vars_files directive in your playbook. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
Using include_vars in Tasks

You can use the include_vars task within your role's tasks to load variables from specific files:

yaml

- name: Include vars from vars directory
  include_vars:
    dir: vars
    files:
      - file1.yml
      - file2.yml
      - file3.yml

In this example:

    dir: vars specifies the directory where your variable files are located (relative to your role's directory).
    files lists the specific variable files you want to include.

Using vars_files in Playbook

If you prefer to include these variable files directly from your playbook, you can use the vars_files directive:

yaml

- name: Playbook example
  hosts: your_hosts
  vars_files:
    - roles/your_role/vars/file1.yml
    - roles/your_role/vars/file2.yml
    - roles/your_role/vars/file3.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Your tasks here
      # Your tasks go here

In this example:

    vars_files lists the paths to the variable files relative to your playbook. Adjust the paths based on your actual directory structure.

Best Practice Tip

It's a good practice to keep your variable files named descriptively and organized logically within the vars directory. This makes it easier to manage and understand your role's variables.

By using include_vars or vars_files, you can effectively import variables from multiple files into your tasks or playbook, keeping your Ansible role organized and modular. Adjust the paths and filenames as per your specific directory structure and naming conventions.
